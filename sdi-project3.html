<p>Expanding on the previous week, I was able to incorporate different manufactures of dirt bikes. Also I added more complexity with the use of objects and json.
<p>I made it able to insert a new bike manufacture and then list it with a while loop. The json contains the information on the different jump's names and sizes.<p>
<p>This makes for the jumps and bikes to be dynamic. </p>
