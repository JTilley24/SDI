<p>I decided to return to story about dirt biking because I enjoy riding in my spare time.<p>
<p>The string function is a representation of a rider’s inner thoughts to self-motivate. For the Boolean function, 
I decided to go with a true or false situation if the rider loses control due to traction. The rider will either finish the jump safely or “wipe out”.<p>
<p>The outputs show the rider continuing to hit the jump its highest point then outputs the speed it was reached at. <p>
